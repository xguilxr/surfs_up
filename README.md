 1. In June, the lowest temperature is of 64 F and highest is 85 with an average of 75 Degrees.
 2. In December, the lowest temperature is of 56 F and highest is 83 with an average of 71 Degrees.
 3. The weather is very similar in both parts of the year which can help have a higher probability of constant sells.

Two additional queries that might be done can be:
