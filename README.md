## Overview

This analysis plans to explore Hawaii's climate and its trends to evaluate the possibility of opening a surf shop there. The analysis focuses on the months of June and December to create a comparative analysis. 

## Results

The two tables below show the summary statistics for the months of June and December:

 ![June](surfs_up/Resources/June_Temps.png) ![December](surfs_up/Resources/December_Temps.png)
 
 1. In June, the lowest temperature is of 64 F and highest is 85 with an average of 75 Degrees.
 2. In December, the lowest temperature is of 56 F and highest is 83 with an average of 71 Degrees.
 3. The weather is very similar in both parts of the year which can help have a higher probability of constant sells. 

## Summary

In general, both months show very close temperatures with December having bigger variances. 

Two additional queries that might be done can be:

- Precipitation throught the year and in those months.
- Temperature in the stations closer to the beaches.
